\description{
RQR for GLMM
Computes the randomized quantile residuals for GLMM
}
\details{
Randomized quantile residuals (RQR) are computed for GLMMM. The within-cluster families considered
are Poisson, Negative Binomial with additive and proportional extra-dispersion and their zero-inflated extensions.
For further details on RQR see Dunn and Smyth (1996) and Feng et al (2020)
